# cf-java [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joergen7/cf-java.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joergen7/cf-java)

###### Java bindings for Cuneiform

This Java library encapsulates all communication with a Cuneiform interpreter service as implemented by [cf_lang](https://github.com/joergen7/cf_lang). cf-java is used to send a workflow to the interpreter, receive workflow task invocations which can be executed using [effi](https://github.com/joergen7/effi), send back the invocation result to the interpreter service, and receive the workflow result once all task invocations have been processed.

The communication protocols must be expected to change over time. Thus, [cf-java 0.0.3-RELEASE](https://github.com/joergen7/cf-java/releases/tag/0.0.3-RELEASE) is compatible with [cf_lang 0.1.0](https://github.com/joergen7/cf_lang/releases/tag/0.1.0) and [effi 0.1.3](https://github.com/joergen7/effi/releases/tag/0.1.3). No other version combination of these tools can be expected to work.

## Usage

### Adding cf-java to a Maven project

The following dependencies and repositories need to be added to your `pom.xml` to add the cf-java library to the dependencies of a given Maven project:

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>de.hu-berlin.wbi</groupId>
            <artifactId>cf-java</artifactId>
            <version>0.0.3-RELEASE</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>ossrh</id>
            <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public</url>
        </repository>
    </repositories>

### Workflow Life Cycle

This library controls the complete life cycle of a workflow, i.e., it is used to drive a workflow from the user perspective:

- committing a workflow source
- receiving a workflow result

as well as to act as from the perspective of the (possibly distributed) execution environment

- receiving a task invocation from the interpreter
- committing a task result after executing it.

To the outside, the cf-java library connects to an interpreter instance via a TCP connection which is held open for the duration of the workflow run. To the inside, it appears as a passive Java object which can be queried. Herein, none of the methods are actually blocking, enabling a workflow driver (user interface plus execution environment) to interact asynchronously with the interpreter service, which lives in its own domain.
